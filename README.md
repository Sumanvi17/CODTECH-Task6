Overview of the project:

Project: Python Program to build a robust online marketplace



Objective:
 
The objective of this project is to perform Python Program to build a robust online marketplace similar to Amazon or eBay, allowing users to buy and sell products or services. Implement advanced features such as seller storefronts, product listings with images and descriptions, reviews and ratings, advanced search and filtering options.


Key Activities:

1. Designed and implemented a simple calculator program in Python.
2. Developed a user-friendly interface to take input from users.
3. Implemented logic to perform arithmetic operations based on user input.
4. Handled invalid input and division by zero errors.
5. Tested the program to ensure correct functionality.

 
Technologies Used:

- Python 
- Basic arithmetic operations


Features:

- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Asks the user to choose an operation (+, -, *, /).
- Performs the selected operation and displays the result.
- Handles invalid input and division by zero errors.


 Key Insights:

1. Modular design: The program uses a modular design, with separate methods for each arithmetic operation. This makes the code more organized, reusable, and easier to maintain.
2. Error handling: The program includes basic error handling, such as checking for division by zero and handling invalid user input.
3. User interaction: The program uses a simple text-based menu to interact with the user, making it easy to use and understand.
4. Recursive functionality: The calculate method calls itself recursively to allow users to perform multiple calculations without having to restart the program.
